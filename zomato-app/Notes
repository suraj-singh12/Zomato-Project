## Note 1: 
Any API interaction should happen through state only.

## Note 2 (Build) 
1. After you have completed your application fully, (i.e. everything is working and is live: Backend, database ,  APIs, every component is live and working) then run the command:

```npm
npm run build
```
> and you will get a build of your application in `build` folder.

2. Anytime you make any changes to your application, run the command again.

3. Then go to the website https://www.netlify.com and SIGN up / login with Git.

4. On the landing page there, you will find a field saying `Drag and drop your site output folder here`

5. Drag and drop your `build` folder into that. 

6. Wait for a minute and refresh the page, then you will get a live `url` of your app.

7. Go in change site settings, and change the name of your app, so it looks good. Then your `url` will also get updated. Use the new one.

> If it doesn't work, wait for some time (say 2 min), if still doesn't works then delete it once, and redo the things. 

## So at the end we have everything as live: 
1. Database: on MongoDb Atlas (i.e. in Cloud)

2. Heroku  : 
  a. Backend API, 
  b. Login API, 
  c. Payment gateway

3. FrontEnd: on netlify
